Basic rules to take care of:
1. Starting interval:  mostly start and end points are 0 and n-1 respectively .
2. mid value : mid value id mostly the (start+end)/2
3. next loop index: it should be take care in such a way that next value should not include the already visited value
        i.e., start=mid+1 & end=mid-1

4. while loop conditions : need to be taken care so that the loop does not be in infinite 
    mostly use 

    while(start<end)
